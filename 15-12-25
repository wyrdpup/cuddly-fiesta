# with inspiration from someone also learning with "30 days of python" this will also be a dump of things I've been learning
# I will probably get things wrong or misunderstand things - so I think writing down my logic in one place so I can either revisit it or identify where I went wrong coming from point A to point B is going to be helpful!



# CONCEPT: what's a shell?
  # The environment where a code actually is run

  # You can write in a shell, but probably don't :) 

  # The output of a shell does contain all the context of whatever the code has, so it can be amended in the shell without needing to redefine anything - just make sure you're following the logic of your code!

  

# CONCEPT: what's an editor?
  # The environment for writing code. Easy to edit (unsurprising) 

  # You can generally run code in editors to test it. Does not automatically print values, whereas a shell will 
  

# CONCEPT: what's a variable?
  # A variable is a symbolic representation of a value. 
  # A variable doesn't mean anything by itself - they need to be defined. For example a variable named 1 isn't understood as the number, unless the value it has is 1 (e.g 1 = 1)
  # "Bucket analogy" can be helpful. When empty it is a bucket. When a value added the variable can be become a bucket of water, bucket of 324542, bucket of True, bucket of entire blocks of code under a loop.
  
  # Variables are a very basic but very essential concept to understand as their logic/rules sets how EVERYTHING ELSE works...or doesn't :)

      # KEY PARTS OF VARIABLES:
        # 1. name - how to make a variable unique with a distinct definition. Note that the name means ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to python itself and only really cares about variable names matching what the code wants or not being contradictory (e.g two variables with the same name)
          # e.g "name_check = a, b" and "name = first, last" are functionally identical
        # best practise for names is lowercase with underscores (this_is_a_variable, this_is_another_variable) and use something descriptive for readability

      # 2. type - there are a solid mumber of variable types, but some basic ones include:
          # strings (str) - ("hello")
          # integer (int) - (30)
          # float - (30.3) (basically, 'number with decimal')
          # boolean - (True or False) 
          # none - (None) (important to note this is DISTINCT to 0 or nothing)
          # tuple - animal = ("dog", "cat", "bird")
              # I will go into tuples in more detail later on, but it's important to note that these are distinct from lists in that a tuple can't be edited whereas a list can be manipulated 
          # list - animal = ["dog", "cat," "bird"]
              # Similarly I will expand on this more later, but this list can be spliced

# Things I did today:

# Out of curiosity (and optimism) I looked what programming language junior jobs in my area look for. Obviously this is something that is a year or more away from being remotely feasible, and who knows if I'll stick out past a month - though I've been doing this for 2+ weeks which is a good habit! 
# TypeScript seems common, along with Python. SQL, .Net Stack, Node.js as well. So I swapped from GoLang to TypeScript, unless this changes in the next 12 months :)
# Most junior positions state "or equivalent experience" to compsci degrees. I do have a degree in an unrelated field and some coding experience from that (fairly limited) as well as some industry specific software that benefitted from knowing a bit (ArcGIS, RStudio). So I guess it isn't totally hopeless bullshit, even if I'd probably be competing with a bunch of 20 somethings (workplace experience is a positive?!)

# Revisited very simple loops with for & if - no concrete lessons today, I just asked for some challenges in training
# I felt pretty ok with these! I did struggle with them last week, so it is nice to go back to something and see I have built my understanding up a little. I still trip over "obvious" mistakes (wrong mathematical symbol, typos, quotes where they are(n't) needed, forgetting when to use == v = but I think those come with time...maybe



# This was a simple loop to create a `count_high_scores` function

def count_high_scores(scores, threshold): ### scores are intergers (player scores), threshold is an interger (whatever the high score is)
    counter = 0  # basic counter
    for score in scores: # saying 'score' should take the element from 'scores' 
        if score >= threshold: # when the value of score is greater or equal to the value of threshold
            counter += 1 # add one to the counter
    return counter # says "count_high_score" should return the value of counter when called - this would show how many high scores we had


#And built on with these two:

def count_rare_ingredients (ingredients, rare_item_name):
    base = 0
    for rare in ingredients:
        if rare = rare_item_name:
            base += 1
    return base




    def count_strong_adventurers(adventurers_strength, minimum_strength):
        counter = 0
        for strong in adventurers_strength:
            if strong >= minimum_strength:
                counter += 1
        return counter


# all of these just involved integers, and I then was given an example challenge that combined lists with string values - this was a lot harder and I couldn't solve parts of it, as I've only very recently finished the basic introduction to lists

# the challenge was to remove all instances of "Broken..." from a list for repairing items
# this involved specifying using the indexes of a range the length of the item_list variable
# we then created a variable called "current_item" which took on the value of `item_list[index]` (so whatever was in the item_list value at a given index within the range)
# our if criteria was asking "if the value of current_item starts with "Broken " ...the space is important here, as it includes things like "Broken Shield". Without it, it would only find the word "Broken"
# for items that met the if criteria, we then used replace to take "Broken " and replace it with "". This would turn Broken Shield into Shield within the value of current_item
# we then say that the value of item_list at whatever index is now equal to the value of current_item, overwriting what was there
# we then return entire item_list (which would be a list)


def repair_broken_items(item_list):
    for index in range(len(item_list)):
       current_item = item_list[index]              
           if current_item.startswith("Broken "):   
               current item = current_item.replace("Broken ", "")
                item_list[index] = current_item    
    return item_list


# Rephrasing my understanding: 
# 1. definition made, argument of item_list
# 2. our 'for' criteria starts using with every index using the range of the length of the variable item_list: 
# 3. we create 'current_item' which we use within this function only. we get this from the index of item_list
# 4. if the value of current_item then begins with "Broken " (the space is important to include "Broken Shield" for example), we then replace "Broken " with "". This would result in "Broken Shield" becoming "Shield"
# 5. We then say whatever index of `item_list` is currently being used now equals `current item`. If it doesn't meet the criteria of containing Broken , it is the same as it is in the index. Otherwise, Broken  is removed from the string and stored in `current_item`
# 6. Item_list is returned (containing the result of the loop we carried out) when the definition is called

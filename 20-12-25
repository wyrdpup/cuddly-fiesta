# Things I did today:

# Out of curiosity (and optimism) I looked what programming language junior jobs in my area look for. Obviously this is something that is a year or more away from being remotely feasible, and who knows if I'll stick out
# past a month - though I've been doing this for 2+ weeks which is a good habit! 
# TypeScript seems common, along with Python. SQL, .Net Stack, Node.js as well. So I swapped from GoLang to TypeScript, unless this changes in the next 12 months :)
# Most junior positions state "or equivalent experience" to compsci degrees. I do have a degree in an unrelated field and some coding experience from that (fairly limited) as well as some industry specific software that 
# benefitted from knowing a bit (ArcGIS, RStudio). So I guess it isn't totally hopeless bullshit, even if I'd probably be competing with a bunch of 20 somethings (workplace experience is a positive?!)




# I did also think about what sort of personal projects I might want to work on -
# I had the silly idea of using a database of racehorse names to provide a generator assigned umamusume, expanding the horses beyond the JRA. Which of course means it needs to include Phar Lap, seeing as Cinderella Gray has NZ horses too! I thought it'd be fun to include the current gen of JRA racehorses as a perhaps separate point of data (e.g "do you want to scout a classic winner or a rising star?"). I think in theory this is not overly complicated when my knowledge starts to build, but I would need to learn how to randomly select from a library (and realistically a library would get very unweildy very quickly).
# I tracked a lot of data from doing mentor roulette in final fantasy 14. This is all in a CSV file, so I thought it would be "fun" to transform and see what ways I can display the data. It's got 2000 points of data so it's a respectable size! 
    # I can hear the distant memory of pandas stirring in my brain for this (and the horse one...) which I am ignoring because this was extremely poorly explained at me at uni and I have a lot of 'eugh' about as a result
# Simpler project: "is my cat fat?" I'm step-parent to a very fat maine coon cross and thought it'd be funny to compare weights of other cats to her. Bonus silly is that her name is Pascal so you can get your cat weight in Pascals (...not the unit of pressure).
    # If I was more physics minded I'm sure it's possible to figure out PSI. But I am not, and there is a reason I just nod and look at the graph when dealing with pumps at work... :)

# Revisited very simple loops with for & if - no concrete lessons today, I just asked for some challenges in training. I want to keep a habit over the Christmas holiday, even if it's only doing small things 
# or revisiting really basic stuff. 
# I felt pretty ok with these! I did struggle with them last week, so it is nice to go back to something and see I have built my understanding up a little. I still trip over "obvious" mistakes (wrong mathematical symbol, 
# typos, quotes where they are(n't) needed, forgetting when to use == v = but I think those come with time...maybe.


# This was a simple loop to create a `count_high_scores` function for example:

def count_high_scores(scores, threshold): ### scores are intergers (player scores), threshold is an interger (whatever the high score is)
    counter = 0  # basic counter, outside the loop to always start at 0
    for score in scores: # saying the new variable 'score' of should take the element from 'scores' 
        if score >= threshold: # criteria: when the value of score is greater or equal to the value of threshold
            counter += 1 # add one to the counter - this accumulates within the loop
    return counter # says "count_high_score" should return the value of counter when called - this would show how many high scores we had in total


#And built on with these two:

def count_rare_ingredients (ingredients, rare_item_name):
    base = 0
    for rare in ingredients:
        if rare = rare_item_name:
            base += 1
    return base

# Identical structure to above, but using the value of ingredients (stored to the new variable of rare) against the values of rare_item_name and calculating how many rare items we have. As above, this returns the total value
# of "rare items" with the function count_rare_ingredients. 


def count_strong_adventurers(adventurers_strength, minimum_strength):
    counter = 0
    for strong in adventurers_strength:
        if strong >= minimum_strength:
            counter += 1
    return counter

# Again, similar structure - but this one is asking "how many adventurers do we have that meet or exceed the minimum strength value?" This might be for a skill check, for example, and showing how many party members met 
# the requirement. 
# A trip up I had was a) mistyping "minimum_strength" as "maximum_strength" and b) forgetting that >= exists when we want to check if a value is the SAME or GREATER. For people with stronger maths backgrounds this doubtless
# comes across as a bit silly, but that isn't me. :)
    # Funnily enough I actually feel I am learning way more about maths trying to self teach code. I keep meaning to make time to go through Khan Academy because I feel revisiting algebra and calculus would help me out 
    # (especially for some more complicated projects...) but I will cross that bridge in the future as to not overwhelm myself I think. I also haven't thought about order of operations in literally decades!


# All of the above just involved integer valus, and I then was given an example challenge that combined lists with string values - this was a lot harder and I couldn't solve parts of it, as I've only very recently finished 
# the basic introduction to lists so it stretched my brain a bit too much to try and apply from the ground up

# The challenge was to remove all instances of "Broken..." from a list. This would be applied to repairing items for example and we just want to change the name of the item.
# This involved specifying using the indexes of a range the length of the item_list variable
# We then created a variable called "current_item" which took on the value of `item_list[index]` (so whatever was in the item_list value at a given index within the range)
# Our "if" criteria was asking "if the value of current_item starts with "Broken " ...the space is important here, as it includes things like "Broken Shield". Without it, it would only find the word "Broken"
# For items that met the if criteria, we then used replace to take "Broken " and replace it with "". This would turn Broken Shield into Shield within the value of current_item
# We then say that the value of item_list at whatever index is now equal to the value of current_item, overwriting what was there
# We then return entire item_list (which would be the whole list)

# Quite a bit going on compared to the above lists! And they will only get more complicated. :) Part of the problem was I had remembered that replace() existed and as a result this was assumed to be known knowledge rather 
# than a half baked memory...
# But even if I didn't KNOW a lot of this, it introduced new concepts and I got through it slowly without quitting. 


def repair_broken_items(item_list):
    for index in range(len(item_list)):
       current_item = item_list[index]              
           if current_item.startswith("Broken "):   
               current item = current_item.replace("Broken ", "")
                item_list[index] = current_item    
    return item_list


# Rephrasing my understanding: 
# 1. definition made, argument of item_list
# 2. our 'for' criteria starts using with every index using the range of the length of the variable item_list: 
# 3. we create 'current_item' which we use within this function only. we get this from the index of item_list
# 4. if the value of current_item then begins with "Broken " (the space is important to include "Broken Shield" for example), we then replace "Broken " with "". This would result in "Broken Shield" becoming "Shield"
# 5. We then say whatever index of `item_list` is currently being used now equals `current item`. If it doesn't meet the criteria of containing Broken , it is the same as it is in the index. Otherwise, Broken  is removed from the string and stored in `current_item`
# 6. Item_list is returned (containing the result of the loop we carried out) when the definition is called

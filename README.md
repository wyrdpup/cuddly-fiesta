# cuddly-fiesta
cuddly-fiesta was the randomly generated name for this, so it's a cuddly fiesta of learning things!

I wanted to learn to code, part for my own interest and part for possible applications for career changes. 

I'm focusing on Python, but want to eventually visit Java and TypeScript. These just seem common in my country.

I don't have masses of experience - my degree had me using a bit of Python as far as it was involved in RStudio, but didn't really go too in depth into it - but I'm going to give it a try and want to leave my notes on github as a reminder of what I've learned...and a shame graveyard if I give up. :P

# how I'm learning
I'm using boot.dev as my primary structured resource, with some futurecoder and my own research

This has been good too:

And includes digging through the python documentation and getting rapidly very confused... :)

# a question for YOU!
...how did you get here?!
